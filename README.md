#  Advanced FortiGate Security Profiles – Full Project

This project focuses on implementing, configuring, and testing **advanced FortiGate Security Profiles** within a virtual lab environment.  
The goal is to demonstrate real-world defensive capabilities against malware, phishing, unauthorized applications, and network-level attacks — using professional cybersecurity practices.

---

##  Project Scope
The project covers the full lifecycle of FortiGate protection mechanisms, including:

- **Antivirus (AV)**
- **Web Filtering**
- **Application Control**
- **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)**
- **DNS Filtering**
- **SSL/Deep Inspection**

Each profile was configured, tested, monitored, and validated using controlled attack simulations.

---

##  Lab Environment
All configurations and tests were performed inside **FortiGate 7.6 Labs** using:

- **FortiGate VM**
- **Windows 10 Client**
- **Kali Linux Attacker**
- **Simulated Internet Environment**

This ensures full reproducibility and professional-level security testing.

---

##  Key Technical Achievements
- Configured full FortiGate security stack (AV, Web Filter, IPS, App Control, DNS Filter).
- Enabled flow-based and proxy-based inspection modes with SSL Deep Inspection.
- Simulated and analyzed:
  - Malware download using EICAR test file  
  - Web filtering blocks and overrides  
  - Application Control + bandwidth shaping  
  - IPS detections (port scans, suspicious patterns, botnet C2 signatures)
- Collected logs, screenshots, and monitoring insights from FortiGate GUI.
- Built a complete technical report and a 30-slide presentation explaining configurations and results.
